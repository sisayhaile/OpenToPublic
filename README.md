The script performs the following tasks:
- Creates a resource group named `rg-demo` in the `westus3` region.
- Sets up a hub VNet (`hubVnet`) with 4 subnets.
- Sets up two spoke VNets (`spokeVnetRed` and `spokeVnetBlue`) each with 4 subnets.
- Establishes VNet peering between the hub and each spoke to form a star topology.
